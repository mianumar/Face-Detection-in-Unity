# Face-Detection-in-Unity-using OpenCV
**Face Detection in Unity using opencv python Library**

This GitHub repository contains a face detection project developed in Unity 3D using the "OpenCV+Unity" package from the Unity Asset Store. The project leverages the power of OpenCV's computer vision algorithms to enable real-time and accurate detection of human faces within Unity scenes. By integrating this package into your Unity projects, you can create interactive experiences that respond to the presence and movements of faces. The repository provides all the necessary code and assets, making it easy for developers to incorporate robust face detection functionality into their Unity applications. Get started with face detection in Unity and enhance the interactivity and immersion of your projects using this open-source repository.
